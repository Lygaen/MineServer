# Index - FAQ

A rewrite of Minecraft 1.8.9 in C++ !
It is fricking fast with multi-threading, and other
amazing features and oprimizations.
Informations such as installation, contributing
can be found on [the Github's page](https://github.com/Lygaen/mineserver).
Here's a quick FAQ.

## WHY another server ?
We created another server library because of a small
side project and because we felt the need to create
something to replace all the bloaty-servers Bukkit-based
that are way too inefficient. Even though PaperMC tries
to tackle that by removing the slack of Bukkit, it is
still way too slow compared to other game's current
standards.

## Why bother using C++ ?
Mineserver, in contrast to Mojang's java build, aims
to be *blazingly* fast so that it entirely surpasses
other implementations such as Paper and other. We
could rewrite the server in Java, but, in the end,
using a low-level programming does help the work.

## Why making it Open-Source ?
We made it open source mainly because we want to
share this project and because we don't feel the need
to hide it. We want to help inspire many programmers
that I hope will one day read over this project because
it crosses a lot of programmation concepts.
That's why the code used here should be reusable, readable and
fully documented. For documentation, we use doxygen
which you can see in the bottom-right corner.
This is not the default skin of doyxgen though.

## Why 1.8.9 ?
We also aim for stability, and to help us for that
we only target Minecraft 1.8.9 (because it is used
a lot). Of course, when the project extends in the future,
we aim to support more and more versions. But for the
time being, because we want first to create a strong
architecture, we only support 1.8.9 and theoratically
all 1.8 versions.

## What features do you have compared to other ?
We have several features :
 - We try to be as time-efficient as possible
 - We try to be very memory-efficient, no need for 2Gb
   of RAM anymore just for 2-players play
 - We added fricking **multithreading** which is a
   late addition to Minecraft if we compare it to other games,
   no need for a godly CPU anymore !
 - And many more... (Remember that this is only the start
   of the project)

## Why does the project takes so much time ?
This project takes *sooooo* much time because of its nature.
Because we decided to write it in C++ to leverage its low-levelness,
memory-efficiency and speed. But with great power comes great responsability.
Because of C++ and the way it was designed, it take way more time to
design project using it ! And finally its not like we have 200+
peoples behind keyboards to code this project.

## End note with a touch of existential crisis
If you read all of this (you liar) well done ! If you want
to ask other questions that are not on this page, ask
using [Github's issues system](https://github.com/Lygaen/mineserver/issues).

I (Lygaen) used "we" throughout this FAQ, but I am very alone to
create this project. That's why any help, even from beginners
is welcomed ! I'll always be happy to help you guys
in any way. I don't think that anyone will be reading this
but anyway ! It's like I'm having a existense crisis on
the keyboard, it is very weird...

Nevertheless, I hope that you guys will have a great day (and
go outside for god's sake!) and that reading these small
paragraphs on why I created / still continue to work on
this project will give you a bit of hope of what the open-source
community is able to do with a bit of time. It will be important
that you keep this feeling intact and maybe pass it to another
person later, it might greatly help them in some way or
another...


PS : English is not my main language so all of it might feel
weird to read at first, but I assure you that I'm trying
my best to give you my good vibes and not trying to pluck
your eyeballs !
