# Security Policy
Here's our *very* complete security policy. We will of course complete it later but for now it is just a waste of time to do so.
Because we decided to use C++, I already forsee all of the memory-oriented vulnerabilities...

## Supported Versions
Its not like we got a released version yet.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you encounter any issues / vulnerability on this project, because it has no impact on the time being, just create an issue.
